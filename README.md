### üîê A small webpage library to control the execution of (third party) scripts like analytics

##### Simply drop yett at the top of your html and it will allow you to block and delay the execution of other scripts.

## Background

[‚ùì] **`So, why on Earth would I want to block scripts on my own website?`**

We use `yett` in order to provide [GDPR compliant consent-first-analytics](https://medium.com/snips-ai/gdpr-compliant-website-analytics-putting-users-in-control-684b17a1463f), via an UI like below.

<br>

<h6 align="center"><i>Analytics scripts are blocked until users Accepts, in production on <a href="https://console.snips.ai">https://console.snips.ai</a></i></h6>

<br>

Blocking execution of analytics script (until consent is given) can be done manually, but the problem is that analytics providers often provide minified code embeds that you have to include in your html as they are. If you want to exercise control over their execution, then you have to tamper with this minified JS yourself, which is complex and does not scale well if you load several 3rd party scripts.

Thus we invented `yett`. Just drop in the script and define a domain blacklist - `yett` will take care of the rest ‚ú®.

------

And on a side note, it is technically quite amazing to know that **[a few lines of js](https://medium.com/snips-ai/how-to-block-third-party-scripts-with-a-few-lines-of-javascript-f0b08b9c4c0)** is all you need to control execution of other scripts, even those included with a script tag. üòâ

##### *Also, [yett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yett) has an interesting meaning.*

## Usage

#### [:tv: Demo](https://snipsco.github.io/yett/)

#### Small example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Regular head items here‚Ä¶ -->

    <!-- 1) Add a blacklist -->
    <script>
      window.YETT_BLACKLIST = [
        /my-blacklisted-domain/,
      ]
    </script>
    <!-- 2) Include Yett -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/yett"></script>
    <!-- 3) Profit! -->
    <!-- This script is blocked -->
    <script src="https://my-blacklisted-domain.com/file.js"></script>
    <script>
      // This one too
      (function() {
        var script = document.createElement('script')
        script.setAttribute('src', 'https://my-blacklisted-domain.com/some-file.js')
        script.setAttribute('type', 'application/javascript')
        document.head.appendChild(script)
      })()
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button onclick="window.yett.unblock()">Unblock</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è It is strongly recommended that you [add type attributes](https://github.com/snipsco/yett#add-a-type-attribute-manually) to `<script>` tags having src attributes that you want to block. It is necessary for script execution blocking to work in the Edge browser, and has the benefit of also preventing the scripts from loading in all other major browsers.**

## Add a blacklist

Yett needs a `blacklist`, which is an array of regexes to test urls against.

```html
<script>
    // Add a global variable *before* yett is loaded.
    YETT_BLACKLIST = [
        /www\\.google-analytics\\.com/,
        /piwik\.php/,
        /cdn\.mxpnl\.com/
    ]
</script>
```

### CDN


Finally, include yett with a script tag **before** other scripts you want to delay:

```html
<script src='unpkg.com/yett'></script>
```

Then, use `window.yett.unblock()` to resume execution of the blocked scripts.

### NPM

You can also use npm to install yett:

```bash
npm i yett
```

```js
window.YETT_BLACKLIST = [
    // ... //
]
// Side effects here!
import { unblock } from 'yett'

unblock()
```

### Unblock

```js
unblock(...scriptUrls: String[])
```

> Unblocks blacklisted scripts.

If you don't specify a `scriptUrls` argument, all blocked script will be executed.
Otherwise, only blacklist regexes that match any of the `scriptUrls` provided will be removed, and only the scripts that are not considered as blacklisted anymore will execute.

### Build locally

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/snipsco/yett
cd yett
# Install
npm i
# Serves demo @ localhost:8080
npm run dev
# Build for release
npm run build
```

## Browser compatibility

The most 'advanced' javascript feature that `yett` uses is [MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver), which is compatible with all major browsers as well as `IE11`.

If you need `IE 9/10` compatibility, you will have to use a [polyfill](https://github.com/megawac/MutationObserver.js):

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mutationobserver-shim/dist/mutationobserver.min.js"></script>
```

### Caveats

#### Add a type attribute manually

> Needed for targetting `Microsoft Edge & Internet Explorer`! Adding this property also prevents the script from loading on `Chrome`, `Safari` and `Firefox`.

In order to prevent the execution of the script for `Edge` and `IE` users, you will have to add `type="javascript/blocked"` manually as shown in the example below.

```html
<!-- Add type="javascript/blocked" yourself, otherwise it will "only" work on Chrome/Firefox/Safari -->
<script src="..." type="javascript/blocked"></script>
```

#### Monkey patch

This library monkey patches `document.createElement`. No way around this.

#### Dynamic requests

Scripts loaded using XMLHttpRequest and Fetch are not blocked. It would be trivial to monkey patch them, but most tracking scripts are not loaded using these 2 methods anyway.

## Suggestions

If you have any request or feedback for us feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/snipsco/yett/issues)!

So far we‚Äôre using this library for analytics, but it could also be used to block advertising until consent, and other things we haven‚Äôt thought about yet. We‚Äôre excited to see what use cases the community comes up with!
